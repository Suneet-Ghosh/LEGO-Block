Static Stress Simulation of a LEGO Block using CAD and FEA

Description:
Designed a 3D CAD model of a standard LEGO block using Fusion 360 and conducted a static stress analysis using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The bottom face of the block was constrained to simulate fixed support, while vertical loads were applied on the top face to mimic real-world stacking forces. Material was defined as ABS plastic, matching the actual LEGO composition. Mesh refinement and Von Mises stress analysis were used to identify potential deformation and stress concentration zones.
